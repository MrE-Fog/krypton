# Flask Integration

It is important the you first read [User Auth API](README-USER-AUTH.md). You will need it to be able to use the auth in Flask - there is no special Flask extension module for Krypton! The User Auth API needs to be used in Flask.

For Flask Integration, please see [the example implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/krptn/flaskExample).
