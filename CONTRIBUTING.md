## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is an IAM, which ensures proper encryption of any data.

## Conventions

Naming conventions:

- We use camelCase conevention for attributes, variables, and function names.
- PascalCase for class names.
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- Names starting in _ or __ are not to be accessed directly by the users - they are internals.
- In databases, names starting in _ or __ should only store data required by Krypton - no user data, they are internals.
