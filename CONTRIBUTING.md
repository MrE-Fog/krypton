## Scope of the Project

This project is an IAM. Anything else is out of this scope. It is not (even though it can be used as) a Database solution, cryptographic toolkit, etc...

## Conventions

Naming conventions:
- We use camelCase conevention for attributes, variables, and function names.
- PascalCase for class names.
- UPPER_CASE for constants
- Names starting in _ or __ are not to be accessed directly by the users - they are internals.
- In databases, names starting in _ or __ should only store data required by Krypton - no user data, they are internals.
